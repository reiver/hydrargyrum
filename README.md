# hydrargyrum ☿

**hydrargyrum** is a ☿ **Mercury Protocol** server — and through proxying also a **Gemini Protocol** server.

## Compiling

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) on your system to be able to build it yourself.

But, once you have Go on your system, you can build **hydrargyrum** with the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/reiver/hydrargyrum

cd hydrargyrum

go build
```

This will produce an executable program file named:
```
hydrargyrum
```

That executable program file is what you run to launch the ☿ **Mercury Protocol** server.
